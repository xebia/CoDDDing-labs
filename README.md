# New repository on Xebia GitHub

Welcome to the Xebia GitHub organization!

This organization contains a lot of repos and to keep things organized we kindly ask you to keep the following in mind:

1. Always provide a clear description so that the repo can be recognized in the repository list on GitHub.
2. Modify this [README.md](./README.md) to provide information about the repo, how to run the code, etc.
3. Public repos should adhere to our Quality without Compromise value so that the Xebia organization will be a showcase of nice projects to the outside world.
4. Repositories should be maintained actively (at least bumping dependencies) or else archived/deleted.

If your repo does not satisfy these guidelines, you risk the repository to be deleted.
In the future we plan to implement automatic checking of these guidelines so that abandoned repos will be deleted automatically.
